## Compilation: Linux

- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Install VCPKG](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html)
- Add VCPKG folder to PATH:
  - Option 1: Temporary local environment

    ```bash
    # Assuming that VCPKG cloned and bootstrapped in ~/vcpkg
    export PATH="~/vcpkg;${PATH}"
    ```

  - Option 2: Local environment and Bash profile

    ```bash
    # Assuming that VCPKG cloned and bootstrapped in c:\src\vcpkg
    export PATH="~/vcpkg;${PATH}"
    echo 'export PATH="~/vcpkg;${PATH}"' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

  - **Important Note:** the VCPKG requests installation of additional packages
- Navigate to the folder with the YOUR_FANCY_PROJECT_NAME App

- [Install VCPKG](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html)
- Add VCPKG folder to PATH:

    REM Assuming that VCPKG cloned and bootstrapped in c:\src\vcpkg
    REM setx for the global environment, set for the local
    setx PATH c:\src\vcpkg;%PATH%
    set  PATH c:\src\vcpkg;%PATH%
    ```

  - Option 2: PowerShell
